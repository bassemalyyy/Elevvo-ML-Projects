ðŸ“š Projects Overview
--------------------

### **Task 1: Student Score Prediction**

This project involves building a **regression** model to predict student exam scores. The dataset, **Student Performance Factors (Kaggle)**, includes features like study hours. The process begins with **data cleaning** and **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to understand the dataset's structure and relationships. A **linear regression** model is then trained on the data to estimate the final scores. The model's performance is evaluated using standard **evaluation metrics** like R-squared or Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to determine its accuracy.

-   **Tools:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn

-   **Concepts:** Regression, Evaluation Metrics

### **Task 2: Customer Segmentation**

This project uses **unsupervised learning** to group customers into segments. The recommended dataset, **Mall Customer (Kaggle)**, contains information on income and spending score. The main goal is to identify distinct customer groups. We perform **data scaling** and visualize the data to determine the optimal number of clusters using techniques like the **Elbow Method**. The **K-Means clustering** algorithm is then applied to group the customers, and the results are visualized using 2D plots to show the different segments.

-   **Tools:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn

-   **Concepts:** Clustering, Unsupervised learning

### **Task 3: Forest Cover Type Classification**

This project focuses on **multi-class classification** to predict the forest cover type using the **Covertype (UCI)** dataset. The dataset includes both cartographic and environmental features. Key steps involve **data preprocessing**, including handling categorical features. We then train and evaluate various classification models. The project emphasizes the use of **tree-based models** and **XGBoost**, which is a powerful gradient boosting framework. Model performance is assessed using a **confusion matrix** and by analyzing **feature importance** to understand which variables most influence the prediction.

-   **Tools:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost

-   **Concepts:** Multi-class classification, Tree-based modeling

### **Task 4: Loan Approval Prediction**

This project is a **binary classification** task to predict whether a loan application will be approved using the **Loan-Approval-Prediction-Dataset (Kaggle)**. The dataset is known to have missing values and **imbalanced data**, which are two key challenges addressed in this project. We'll handle missing values and encode categorical features. Because the dataset is imbalanced, the focus shifts from simple accuracy to metrics more suitable for this problem, such as **precision, recall, and the F1-score**.

-   **Tools:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn

-   **Concepts:** Binary classification, Imbalanced data

### **Task 5: Music Genre Classification**

This project classifies songs into different genres using the **GTZAN (Kaggle)** dataset. The process involves extracting audio features, such as **Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs)** or creating **spectrogram images** from the audio files. The project explores two approaches: a **tabular approach** using features like MFCCs with a standard multi-class model, and an **image-based approach** using a **Transfer Learning on RESNet50** on the spectrogram images. The final results from both methods are compared.

-   **Tools:** Python, Librosa, Scikit-learn, Keras

-   **Concepts:** Audio data, Transfer Learning, RESNet50

### **Task 6: Sales Forecasting**

This project is a **time-series analysis** task to predict sales using the **Walmart Sales Forecast (Kaggle)** dataset. The process involves creating time-based features (e.g., day of the week, month, and lagged values) to capture temporal patterns. **Regression models** are then applied to forecast sales for the next period. The project's outcome is a visualization of the predicted sales plotted against the actual sales over time, allowing for a clear assessment of the model's accuracy.

-   **Tools:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn

-   **Concepts:** Time series forecasting, Regression
